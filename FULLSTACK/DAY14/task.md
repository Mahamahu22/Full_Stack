 Library?

A library is like a toolbox.

You pick and use the tools (functions or code) when you want.

You are the boss — you control when and how to use it.

 Example:

jQuery, Lodash, React
(React is called a library because it helps only with the design part — the UI.)

Framework?

A framework is like a building plan.

It gives you a structure, and you build your app inside it.

The framework is the boss — it calls your code when needed.


Example:

Angular, Django, Spring

 Key Difference:

Library: You call the code → You are in control 

Framework: It calls your code → It is in control
