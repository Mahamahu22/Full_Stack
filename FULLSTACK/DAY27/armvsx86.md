# – ARM vs x86 Architecture Comparison

## Aim:
To understand and compare the differences between ARM and x86 CPU architectures.

## Description:
ARM and x86 are two major CPU instruction set architectures. ARM is based on RISC (simpler instructions), whereas x86 is CISC-based (complex instructions).

## Comparison Table:

| Feature           | ARM                                 | x86                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Power Efficiency | ✅ Very high                         | ❌ Lower                              |
| Performance      | ❌ Lower for complex tasks           | ✅ Higher, suitable for multitasking  |
| Heat             | ❄️ Less heat generation             | 🔥 Generates more heat                |
| Cost             | ✅ Low manufacturing cost            | ❌ Higher cost                        |
| Devices          | Smartphones, Tablets, IoT, Raspberry Pi | Desktops, Laptops, Servers        |

## Conclusion:
- ARM is ideal for mobile and embedded devices.
- x86 is better for performance-intensive computing.
