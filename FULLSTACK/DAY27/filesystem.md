# File System Indexing, Memory Management, and Process Scheduling

## Aim:
To learn how an OS handles files, memory, and running tasks efficiently.

---

###  File System Indexing
- Maps files to physical locations on storage.
- Uses data structures like:
  - Inodes
  - FAT (File Allocation Table)
- Enables fast file retrieval and directory navigation.

---

###  Memory Management
- Allocates and deallocates RAM to running programs.
- Main strategies:
  - **Paging** – Fixed-sized blocks of memory
  - **Segmentation** – Logical memory sections (stack, heap)
  - **Virtual Memory** – Simulates extra memory using disk space

---

###  Process Scheduling
- Determines execution order of processes on CPU.
- Algorithms used:
  - FCFS (First Come First Serve)
  - Round Robin
  - SJF (Shortest Job First)
  - Priority Scheduling

## Result:
These systems together ensure efficient and stable OS performance.
